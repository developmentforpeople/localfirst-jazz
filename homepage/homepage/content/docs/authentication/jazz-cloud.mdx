# Jazz Cloud Authentication

The [Jazz Cloud](/cloud) platform provides a comprehensive solution for user management. This integration allows users to sign up or sign in through your Jazz application, using authentication infrastructure managed by us.

## How it works

Jazz Cloud Authentication works by providing a set of APIs that your application can use to authenticate users. These APIs are designed to be used in conjunction with the [Jazz Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.jazz.tools/), which provides a user interface for configuring managed [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) servers for your application.

### Developer

To integrate Jazz Cloud Authentication into your application, follow these steps:

1. Register your application in the Jazz Cloud Dashboard.
  - The application will be assigned an authentication URL for every environment; this URL must be supplied to the authentication client.
2. Add the authentication client to your application.
3. Implement the UI for your application's supported authentication methods.

### User

When using Jazz Cloud Authentication, users:

1. Sign up or sign in through your Jazz application.
2. Jazz Cloud securely stores the user's account keys and provides a seamless authentication experience.
3. When logging in, Jazz retrieves the user's account keys from Jazz Cloud.
4. Users can work offline with full Jazz functionality.

This authentication method is not fully local-first, as it relies on a connection to Jazz Cloud to authenticate and retrieve account keys.

## Key benefits

- **Multi-tenancy**: Authentication separated across application environments.
- **Developer-friendly**: Easy integration and setup.
- **Methods supported**: Email & password and OAuth providers supported out-of-the-box.
- **User-friendly**: Standard authentication flows users already know.

## Examples

You can explore Jazz applications using Jazz Cloud Authentication integration in our [example projects](/docs/examples).

## When to use Jazz Cloud

Jazz Cloud Authentication is appropriate when:

- You want a traditional & seamless authentication experience for your users.
- You do not want to manage user accounts yourself.
- You want multi-tenant authentication across application environments.
- Your application would benefit from email & password authentication, with password resets and email verification.
- Your application would benefit from social sign-on, such as through Google or GitHub.
- You want to avoid users managing their own account keys.

## Limitations and considerations

- **Online requirement**: Internet connectivity is required when authenticating.
